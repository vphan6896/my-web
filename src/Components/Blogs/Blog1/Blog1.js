            <h3 className="has-text-weight-medium is-size-4">What's Pi-Hole and why?</h3>
            <p className={blockStyle}>
                Here is the wiki: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-hole">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-hole</a>. Simplified,
                it helps you filter out ads by 'blocking' the ad's source server. This is a Linux software solution and can be deployed
                on a host-level basis or a network-level basis. So while one might have 
                <a href="https://www.getadblock.com/en/"> Adblock</a> or 
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm"> UBlockOrigin</a> on Google Chrome
                as extensions to reduce the intrusive ads a user may encounter during browsing, Pi-Holes tackle a lower level 
                (Think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI Model</a>). Instead of allowing the client to establish connection
                with ad providers, the client receives a blank result therefore saving time and bandwidth. This is not fool-proof as there
                clever ways to circumventing pi-holes. Google serve ads for instance are served from the same servers as many of their other content
                is. To attempt blocking that, you would receive false-positives and effectively not be able to browse the internet at all. It is best 
                to supplement ad-blocking softwares with a Pi-hole rather than looking at them as direct alternatives.
            </p>

            <h3 className="has-text-weight-medium is-size-4">Equipment</h3>
            <p className={blockStyle}>
              I started off with a family member's unused laptop. It was a Samsung Windows 7 Laptop with a new 120 GB hard drive that took about 3 minutes to boot 
              up. There were no ethernet ports on it and the usb wifi/ethernet speeds were very limited with this laptop. Though a Pi-Hole does not use much 
              bandwidth, browsing and downloading software took multitudes longer than the modern 2010 or newer computers. You will need the ability to provide
               your pi-hole a static ip address, and if you want to deploy it network-wide, you will need access to the DNS settings for the router. 
            </p>

            <h3 className="has-text-weight-medium is-size-4">Deploying</h3>
            <p className={blockStyle}>
              At the time I was working with this laptop, I did not want to spend the money to buy an actual Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately, I do not have all the details
               of when I tried messing with Virtual Machines to deploy Pi-Hole. All I remember is that it was difficult to expose the virtual machine's IP address to 
               the home network devices (Bridged or host-only Networking is what you would look for to expose the VM's IP to your home network).
                That alone stops you from using the Pi-Hole's IP Address as your DNS server and defeats the whole purpose. Because this laptop
                is not Linux-based, I had to resort to deploying pi-hole through Docker. There were some roadblocks on installing Docker. The newest Docker application
                was not compatible with the Samsung laptop's OS so Docker Toolbox had to be installed. The process to running commands to install Pi-Hole is simple, so
                that will be skipped. The result was Pi-Hole running and the container could ping Google and my other local devices. However, I could not access the 
                Pi-Hole web interface (one visual confirmation of Pi-Hole successful deployment). I even enabled ssh into my container and checked the
              <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/prerequisites/"> required ports </a> were functioning by checking Pi-Hole's status. Reflecting back on this, I wonder
              if a Windows 7 default firewall setting may have blocked some of the ports. Unsatisfied with my hours of looking through forums and even creating my own
              post, I just went to my Windows 10 PC and repeated the same steps (with the new Docker, not Docker toolbox). This worked. And yes, you can connect 
              to your own container (this was tied to my PC's IP) for DNS.
            </p>

            <h3 className="has-text-weight-medium is-size-4">Hyper-V vs My Convenience</h3>
            <p className={blockStyle}>
              There is a phone emulator called <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/"> BlueStacks </a> that I use to play my mobile games. This software requires 
              Hyper-V and other virtualization Windows settings to be disabled. As of 2020, BlueStacks does have a new emulator that can run with Hyper-V, but
              in my experience, I still ran into errors having Docker and BlueStacks up. I took a pause at this time to mull over my Pi-hole deployment and use 
              case. I would have to keep my hefty gaming computer up all day to keep pi-hole running for my other devices to benefit from... This is when I 
              caved in and bought a used Raspberry Pi 4 on Ebay (Be environmental and cheap!).
            </p>

            <h3 className="has-text-weight-medium is-size-4">Ï€ Time</h3>
            <p className={blockStyle}>
              Installing the Raspberry Pi OS was a breeze. I used BalenaEtcher to burn the OS image onto a microSD card which promptly went into the Pi.
              While using a Windows computer, remember to create an empty file called 'ssh' with no file extensions and place that file onto the root of the microSD
              card to enable ssh on your Pi. To skip setting up internet connection, I plugged an ethernet cable into the Pi and one of my keyboards compatible with
              Linux distributions. The rest of the steps can easily be followed on <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/basic-install/">Pi-Hole's website</a>.
              <p className="has-text-weight-semibold"> Don't forget to change your Pi's default password for security purposes!</p>

              My configuration has a web console for better visibility on ads being blocked per device. It also allowed me to
              whitelist false-positives and add additional blocklists that others have curated (Just look for Pi Hole Adlists on GitHub!) But like installing 
              multiple anti-viruses on one computer (Couldn't be me), too many adlists can restrict your computer's access to the internet. As for the whole experience,
              Setting up a Pi-Hole may be considered easy, but attempting to host the Pi-hole on multiple platforms was several hours of effort split between a few days.
              Aside, but it reminds me of the time my security professor assigned us a simple homework of sshing into the school network while binding our local port
              to the computer's open port while minding the firewall that exists. Ultimately easy, but still required an hour of work if you didn't think about what
              you were doing.
            </p>

            <h3 className="has-text-weight-medium is-size-4">What's left?</h3>
            <p className={blockStyle}>
              Some ads still made it through. Like I mentioned earlier in the blog, some ad providers can still make it through due to their source server effectively being
              the same as the content an internet user would generally view (e.g. Youtube videos and ads being served by Google servers). The Pi-hole definitely improved my
               non-computer devices such as mobile phone experiences when browsing. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way that my Pi-Hole image corrupts when it shuts down
               abruptly. This usually happened in thunderstorms causing blackouts despite being connected to a surge protector with a built-in power supply and would continue
               to cost me 2 microSD cards so far. I tried to revive my microSD cards with multiple 3rd party Windows softwares then resorted to Linux formatting and 
               miscellaneous Linux tools. Supposedly, microSD cards are easy to corrupt especially when writing is occurring. The root cause is still ambiguous as 
               it could be my used Pi may be dysfunctional or that my multiple new microSD cards 
               were of inferior quality. There is a list of 'good' and 'bad' microSD cards for Pi's <a href="https://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards">here</a> with users' anecdotes.
               Overall, this has been a great experience to reduce the already excessive amount of ads found when browsing. Things to improve on would be to look into
               creating an at-home VPN to augment ad-blocking and avoid as much of internet tracking and profiling as I can and to create a more stable Pi-Hole.

              Note on the video above: the DockerFile the author provides should have both dns entries pointing to localhost 127.0.0.1.
              Secondary and tertiary DNS server configurations <br/> on a computer will be used even if the primary DNS server works.
              Counter-intuitively, DNS configurations do not fail a DNS server and try the next one you listed.<br/> All 2 or 3 DNS servers 
              will be used in no particular order. If I remember correctly, there was an issue of the Pi-hole querying and logging twice
              if you list the same DNS twice in the Dockerfile.
