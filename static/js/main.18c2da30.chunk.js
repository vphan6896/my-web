When I was coding or typing an essay, pressing the left shift key on a Dell membrane keyboard was extremely hard. If I type a "abcdef" quickly, it would register as "acef".

What better to do then to consult a friend who knows more than me?

This housing would provide a more firm and solid feel than that of the Cherry's which can further dampen any unwanted sound.
