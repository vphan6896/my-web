You can look up on more history behind them but an example\r\n            of an early mechanical keyboard would be the typewriter or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard\">\r\n            Model M Keyboard from IBM\r\n            </a>. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            In summary, mechanical keyboards offer the end-user what every mouse does: functionality with feedback. Ever notice your mouse clicks make that \"clicky\" sound?\r\n            That was in-place partly to inform the user that your attempt to press down on the mouse was sufficient to trigger the mouse button. Basic physics but\r\n            this is what keyboards do for us as well.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            If you get deeper into the keyboard hobby, you'll start to notice the finer details such as the sound profile of each keyboard. There may be keyboards with\r\n            more <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HF0ZlqMe3rw?t=6\"> distinct tappy sounds \r\n            </a> or maybe the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/x_VRaHneWto?t=99\">sound of their clicky switches overwhelm the reverb of the switches</a>.\r\n            Then there's the aesthetic part of keyboards\r\n            which can be appreciated by everyone. Once you move past the ostentatious leds and their numerous settings, you can coordinate color schemes and even get \r\n            custom-made keycaps to bring some personality to your battlestation. <br/>\r\n            <img style={bodyImage0} src={matcha} alt=\"soft shades of green colored keycaps\"/> <img style={bodyImage0} src={keycap} alt=\"keycap with Mount Fuji model inside resin\"/> \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <h3 className={blockTitle}>So why build my own custom one?</h3>\r\n            I dislike membrane keyboards (what you see in offices and schools). It's debatable that they're almost as loud as a mechanical keyboard depending on a user's typing behavior.\r\n            They are difficult to repair due to lack of support and sometimes keys get stuck or not register. When I was coding or typing an essay, pressing the left shift key\r\n            on a Dell membrane keyboard was extremely hard. If I type a \"abcdef\" quickly, it would register as \"acef\". Failure to register keystrokes is called ghosting. \r\n            Good quality keyboards will try to implement anti-ghosting but nothing is perfect. Especially not a Dell keyboard built with low quality parts. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            Now, not all non-mechanical keyboards are bad. I am very comfortable typing on laptop keyboards Macs and\r\n            Windows alike. Windows laptops have scissor switches which like other commercial non-mechanical keyboards are difficult to repair (My '-'' minus key is still broken\r\n            on my laptop) and suffer ghosting as well. With less resistance than a membrane keyboard, laptop keyboards have a reactive, light stroke feeling to them which makes\r\n            them comfortable for typing. Fair warning, if you even buy a keyboard from a large company like Logitech, appreciate it for a few years, somehow lost your 'e' key, \r\n            then it's possible your warranty expired or Logitech no longer has any spare parts to send to you (even if they did, you'll be expecting $5 for a single letter).\r\n            Not to mention, replacing a scissor switch on a laptop is a lot harder than the mechanical keyboards' plug-n-play.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <a href=\"https://switchandclick.com/cherry-mx-guide/\"> Guide to Cherry (most popular types of switches) switches</a>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            My goal was to build a quiet linear keyboard with custom keycaps outlined in white for backlight capability as you can see at the top of the page. Linears eliminate\r\n            sound from the mechanical switch. I've used Cherry MX reds before from a <a href=\"https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/CORSAIR-Gaming-K70-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-%E2%80%94-CHERRY%C2%AE-MX-Red/p/CH-9000069-NA\">\r\n            Corsair K70 </a>. They're light to press on but still make a significant sound when typing. A quick google search showed there were Cherry MX Silent Red switches \r\n            which were basically red switches but had rubber dampeners at the bottom to cut some of the sound of pressing down on a key. Then I thought, if I'm going out of my \r\n            way to find a vendor that makes custom keycaps, I might as well make my switches feel a little more premium feeling. What better to do then to consult a friend who \r\n            knows more than me? TLDR: He recommended putting the Cherry MX Red Silent stem (inside part of a switch) in a Tealios housing (outside casing part of a switch). \r\n            This housing would provide a more firm and solid feel than that of the Cherry's which can further dampen any unwanted sound. One flaw with this frankenswitch is\r\n            paying for twice the amount of switches and the labor to swap the parts out. It's not a difficult thing to do, but it is tedious.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <h3 className={blockTitle}>Switches. Okay, what about them fancy engraved keycaps?</h3>\r\n            Although I memorized the ANSI keyboard layout (This isn't impressive.) and can tell which key is which with my eyes closed, I wanted to leave the legend on the side \r\n            for less experienced typists using my computer. This would also prevent the legend from distracting the viewer from the keycap artwork. Now begins the search for \r\n            a manufacturer.\r\n            I've done lots of Googling to find a place that would do custom keycaps. I've checked solutionsinplastic.com who does injection molding and other custom\r\n            buttons for machinery (ones you would find in a factory). They don't do computer keyboards. Lots of Reddit posts point you in the direction of customization\r\n             in the form of mix-matching different colored keycaps. <a href=\"https://pimpmykeyboard.com/\"> Link here if interested </a> Which is great in itself but isn't the \r\n            backlit keycaps I envisioned. Finally, I found wasdkeyboards.com and maxkeyboards.com. Wasdkeyboards wasn't as upfront about their custom keycap options, so maxkeyboards\r\n            received more of my traffic. Additionally, maxkeyboards had an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxkeyboards/\">Instagram</a> showing their past work.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <h3 className={blockTitle}>Designing the files for the vendor</h3>\r\n            Maxkeyboards ordering system for custom keycaps is direct contact with their email support. I tried to be self-sufficient by downloading their keycaps template\r\n            files and working my image onto the keycaps on Inkscape. I had no prior experience working with vector graphics but did understand the concept of layers in art\r\n            from previous tinkering with other art tools long ago. The magic of the internet provided a video with the exact instructions on imprinting an image onto keycaps:\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3XuDNFCfWg&ab_channel=TheWiggin\"> Here.</a> Even with the video, there was still some struggling through the layers, resizing\r\n            images, and multi-selection before clipping was successful. All there was to do was to email the files, complete transaction and carry on.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <img className={bodyImage0} src={design} alt=\"Screenshot of Inkscape UI with keycaps template\" />\r\n\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <h3 className={blockTitle}>Looking for a Case</h3>\r\n            Upfront, I wanted a full keyboard. Numpad and function keys. Oftentimes, many mechanical keyboard enthusiasts' keyboards are TKL (without numpads) or a 60% form.\r\n            They seem to have prejudice against numpads. But in my use case, I use it for extra mappings in video games, simple arithmetic and the occasional pin number entry.\r\n            Not to mention alt+codes that generate special characters such as smiley face ☺, em dash — and en dash – were essential for internet banter and fun. You cannot \r\n            do this with the number row key.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            In addition to the difficulty of acquiring a full-sized mechanical keyboard case is being hot-swappable. I have soldering equipment and can solder (experience\r\n            from working on video game consoles), but did not want to spend hours potentially messing up the keyboard PCB when soldering switches in. Last but not least,\r\n            there had to be backlight. (How else will my engraved keycaps truly shine?) My search came across the <a href=\"https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-c2-wired-mechanical-keyboard?variant=32294075170905]\">\r\n            Keychron C2</a>. This keyboard worked well but was difficult to pry open and had gaps between the function row keys. The gaps between the function row keys\r\n            ruined the keycap artwork unity.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <img className={bodyImage0} src={keychron} alt=\"Keychron C2 keyboard with custom keycaps\"/>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            More to review on the keycaps I designed and received... It is a bit difficult to discern the foreground and background, and the backlight was not customizable and was only white.\r\n            I did add foam to the Keychron C2 thanks to my sore fingers, this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keychron/comments/liv7ek/free_keychron_c2_foam_mod/\">\r\n              Reddit post</a>, and lots of spudging tools. This immensely reduced the reverb from typing. All there's left is to find another keyboard that better fit \r\n            my keycaps artwork which brings me to more Googling: <a href=\"https://epomaker.com/products/gk96s\">the GK96s</a>. Here is a \r\n            <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/kws5w2/epomaker_gk96ls_reviewish/\"> review</a>. The TLDR: it's only 96%, but is hot-swappable.\r\n            Bonuses are its bluetooth capability and key remapping (the scroll lock key can become delete).\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <h3 className={blockTitle}>Putting it altogether.</h3>\r\n            I know the blog is a bit out of order, but bear with me. Assume my frankenswitches, custom keycaps (obviously), GK96s, and any modding tools have arrived. You will\r\n            want a switch puller, keycap puller (2-in-1's work okay), and a screwdriver at the very least for any mechanical keyboard. The switches were already lubed but for that\r\n            extra sound dampening, I filmed the alphanumeric keys with Deskeys foam switch films. Here is a video of someone else's experiment:\r\n             <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiD5FCWZloE&ab_channel=Histy\"> video</a>. The GK96s was easy to disassemble due to its reliance on screws instead of snap-on tabs.\r\n            After opening it, I added foam:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <img className={bodyImage0} src={foam} alt=\"Keyboard case with foam in it\"/>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            Then, there is a bane of all keyboard enthusiasts: stabilizer keys. If you think I'm being extra... Here is a video of rattly stabilizers vs good stabilizers:\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r56Nsit_4G0&ab_channel=Hitchyy\"> Bad</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQBxG4TWP8w&ab_channel=SSSAK\">Good. (Watch the first 10 seconds only)</a> Stabilizer keys are the larger keys such as the Enter key or the spacebar. Hopefully, stabilizers \r\n            are a self-explanatory term. If you didn't have on on your space bar, the space bar would act like a see-saw/teeter-totter instead of pressing down uniformly. Stabilizers\r\n            with their many potential areas of noise are tedious to mod. Lubing the stabilizer wires \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            What's left is messing with the GK96 software. Let me tell you, it's not easy. After 3 hours of tinkering, I found the most consistent way was to make edits to the\r\n            custom lighting profile, save it, open the profiles page switch from an arbitrary one, save and apply, then switch to the custom one before saving and applying for the final time.\r\n            To add to the confusion, the keyboard has a set of layers (affecting light effects and mappings) and a set of light effect profiles. To change light effect profile (default {\"->\"} our custom one)\r\n            for this keyboard, press fn+(-).\r\n            To turn it on, press fn+(9). Unplugging this device will not turn it off, it will go into Bluetooth mode. To turn it off completely, hold fn+` until all lights are off.\r\n            Also, you cannot overwrite the default keyboard profile for its mappings. You will always have to load your keyboard profile\r\n            if you wanted to have your scroll lock key as delete key.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <img className={headlineImage} src={le1} alt=\"GK96 software showing custom lighting profile settings\"/>\r\n            <img className={headlineImage} src={le2} alt=\"GK96 software showing custom lighting profiles and layers\"/>\r\n\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <h3 className={blockTitle}>Conclusion</h3>\r\n            Please refer to the top of the page for what the keyboard\r\n            looks like. Now, I don't have good equipment for recording a nearly silent keyboard, but here is a video of someone else's exact frankenswitches:\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypi14DazBqw\"> Mx Zilent Sound Test</a>. Look up any other keyboard sound test while keeping the same volume on your\r\n            computer and you will quickly notice there is a vast difference in sound amplitudes. I assure you, it isn't majorly the recording equipment differences. The\r\n            MX Zilents are just that silent. More silent than regular membrane keyboards and more silent than laptop keyboards.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n            I hope my journey into custom mechanical keyboards has been informative or serve well as a documentation for my future self to reflect on.\r\n            Although I spent too much money (especially on the custom keycaps) on what one could argue as unnecessary features, the learning process has been insightful. \r\n            It's easy to dismiss other people's hobbies when you're ignorant of the finer details, but I chose to investigate it and come out with a \r\n            product for myself. Don't use my experience as the average. A nice mechanical keyboard can be as cheap as $20 with thoughtful modding and using materials around the house\r\n            (packaging foam, t-shirts, screw drivers, etc.) Don't let enthusiasts and their jargon scare you. Find what you like, and set forth to realize your goals.\r\n            I can tell you having created a literal one-of-a-kind in the entire world keyboard made almost exactly to my exact \r\n            specifications has brought me great satisfaction and I still enjoy the nearly absolute silent keyboard for my everyday use. There will be a later blog on\r\n            how I eliminated the mouse click sounds ☺.\r\n            </p>\r\n            \r\n          <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <hr style={{\"border-top\":\"2px solid black\"}}/>\r\n          </div>\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          credits={\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/736-history-of-mechanical-keyboards.html\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://switchandclick.com/cherry-mx-guide/\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://drop.com/buy/gks-xda-v2-dye-subbed-pbt-matcha-keycap-set\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://drop.com/buy/bkd-mt-fuji-wood-resin-artisan-keycap\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/DecentKeyboards\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://pimpmykeyboard.com/\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/51qepc/where_can_i_buy_custom_keycaps/\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.maxkeyboard.com/\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxkeyboards/\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3XuDNFCfWg&ab_channel=TheWiggin\"/>\r\n              <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keychron/comments/liv7ek/free_keychron_c2_foam_mod/\"/>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          }\r\n          />\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Blog0;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Pi-hole_logo.2d6af045.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/pi_4.dbb9d1aa.jpg\";","import pi_logo from './Pi-hole_logo.png'\r\nimport Blog from '../../Blog/Blog'\r\nimport BlogCredit from '../BlogCredit';\r\nimport pi_4 from './pi_4.jpg'\r\n\r\nfunction Blog1() {\r\n\r\n    var headlineImage = {\r\n        \"height\":\"200px\",\r\n        \"width\":\"400px\",\r\n        \"marginBottom\":\"10px\"\r\n    }\r\n    var bodyImage0 = {\r\n        \"height\":\"300px\",\r\n        \"width\":\"300px\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var blockStyle=\"is-size-5 block\";\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n          <Blog title=\"Pi-Holes\" subtitle=\"on a 2008 laptop, Docker, then an actual Raspberry Pi\"\r\n          body={\r\n          <div>\r\n           <img style={headlineImage} src={pi_logo} alt=\"Raspberry Pi and Docker logos on top of a No Ads sign\"/>\r\n          <h3 className=\"has-text-weight-medium is-size-4\">TLDR</h3>\r\n          <ul className={blockStyle}>\r\n            <li>The old laptop was outdated on its drivers and had a chain of issues.

Simplified,\r\n                it helps you filter out ads by 'blocking' the ad's source server. This is a Linux software solution and can be deployed\r\n                on a host-level basis or a network-level basis. So while one might have \r\n                <a href=\"https://www.getadblock.com/en/\"> Adblock</a> or \r\n                <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm\"> UBlockOrigin</a> on Google Chrome\r\n                as extensions to reduce the intrusive ads a user may encounter during browsing, Pi-Holes tackle a lower level \r\n                (Think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model\">OSI Model</a>). Instead of allowing the client to establish connection\r\n                with ad providers, the client receives a blank result therefore saving time and bandwidth. This is not fool-proof as there\r\n                clever ways to circumventing pi-holes. Google serve ads for instance are served from the same servers as many of their other content\r\n                is. To attempt blocking that, you would receive false-positives and effectively not be able to browse the internet at all. It is best \r\n                to supplement ad-blocking softwares with a Pi-hole rather than looking at them as direct alternatives.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"has-text-weight-medium is-size-4\">Equipment</h3>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n              I started off with a family member's unused laptop. It was a Samsung Windows 7 Laptop with a new 120 GB hard drive that took about 3 minutes to boot \r\n              up. There were no ethernet ports on it and the usb wifi/ethernet speeds were very limited with this laptop. Though a Pi-Hole does not use much \r\n              bandwidth, browsing and downloading software took multitudes longer than the modern 2010 or newer computers. You will need the ability to provide\r\n               your pi-hole a static ip address, and if you want to deploy it network-wide, you will need access to the DNS settings for the router. \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"has-text-weight-medium is-size-4\">Deploying</h3>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n              At the time I was working with this laptop, I did not want to spend the money to buy an actual Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately, I do not have all the details\r\n               of when I tried messing with Virtual Machines to deploy Pi-Hole. All I remember is that it was difficult to expose the virtual machine's IP address to \r\n               the home network devices (Bridged or host-only Networking is what you would look for to expose the VM's IP to your home network).\r\n                That alone stops you from using the Pi-Hole's IP Address as your DNS server and defeats the whole purpose. Because this laptop\r\n                is not Linux-based, I had to resort to deploying pi-hole through Docker. There were some roadblocks on installing Docker. The newest Docker application\r\n                was not compatible with the Samsung laptop's OS so Docker Toolbox had to be installed. The process to running commands to install Pi-Hole is simple, so\r\n                that will be skipped. The result was Pi-Hole running and the container could ping Google and my other local devices. However, I could not access the \r\n                Pi-Hole web interface (one visual confirmation of Pi-Hole successful deployment). I even enabled ssh into my container and checked the\r\n              <a href=\"https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/prerequisites/\"> required ports </a> were functioning by checking Pi-Hole's status. Reflecting back on this, I wonder\r\n              if a Windows 7 default firewall setting may have blocked some of the ports. Unsatisfied with my hours of looking through forums and even creating my own\r\n              post, I just went to my Windows 10 PC and repeated the same steps (with the new Docker, not Docker toolbox). This worked. And yes, you can connect \r\n              to your own container (this was tied to my PC's IP) for DNS.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"has-text-weight-medium is-size-4\">Hyper-V vs My Convenience</h3>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n              There is a phone emulator called <a href=\"https://www.bluestacks.com/\"> BlueStacks </a> that I use to play my mobile games. This software requires \r\n              Hyper-V and other virtualization Windows settings to be disabled. As of 2020, BlueStacks does have a new emulator that can run with Hyper-V, but\r\n              in my experience, I still ran into errors having Docker and BlueStacks up. I took a pause at this time to mull over my Pi-hole deployment and use \r\n              case. I would have to keep my hefty gaming computer up all day to keep pi-hole running for my other devices to benefit from... This is when I \r\n              caved in and bought a used Raspberry Pi 4 on Ebay (Be environmental and cheap!).\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"has-text-weight-medium is-size-4\">π Time</h3>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n              Installing the Raspberry Pi OS was a breeze. I used BalenaEtcher to burn the OS image onto a microSD card which promptly went into the Pi.\r\n              While using a Windows computer, remember to create an empty file called 'ssh' with no file extensions and place that file onto the root of the microSD\r\n              card to enable ssh on your Pi. To skip setting up internet connection, I plugged an ethernet cable into the Pi and one of my keyboards compatible with\r\n              Linux distributions. The rest of the steps can easily be followed on <a href=\"https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/basic-install/\">Pi-Hole's website</a>.\r\n              <p className=\"has-text-weight-semibold\"> Don't forget to change your Pi's default password for security purposes!</p>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <img className={bodyImage0} src={pi_4} alt=\"Red and white case enclosing a Raspberry Pi with hdmi, power, ethernet, and usb cables plugged\"/>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n              My configuration has a web console for better visibility on ads being blocked per device. It also allowed me to\r\n              whitelist false-positives and add additional blocklists that others have curated (Just look for Pi Hole Adlists on GitHub!) But like installing \r\n              multiple anti-viruses on one computer (Couldn't be me), too many adlists can restrict your computer's access to the internet. As for the whole experience,\r\n              Setting up a Pi-Hole may be considered easy, but attempting to host the Pi-hole on multiple platforms was several hours of effort split between a few days.\r\n              Aside, but it reminds me of the time my security professor assigned us a simple homework of sshing into the school network while binding our local port\r\n              to the computer's open port while minding the firewall that exists. Ultimately easy, but still required an hour of work if you didn't think about what\r\n              you were doing.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"has-text-weight-medium is-size-4\">What's left?</h3>\r\n            <p className={blockStyle}>\r\n              Some ads still made it through. Like I mentioned earlier in the blog, some ad providers can still make it through due to their source server effectively being\r\n              the same as the content an internet user would generally view (e.g. Youtube videos and ads being served by Google servers). The Pi-hole definitely improved my\r\n               non-computer devices such as mobile phone experiences when browsing. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way that my Pi-Hole image corrupts when it shuts down\r\n               abruptly. This usually happened in thunderstorms causing blackouts despite being connected to a surge protector with a built-in power supply and would continue\r\n               to cost me 2 microSD cards so far. I tried to revive my microSD cards with multiple 3rd party Windows softwares then resorted to Linux formatting and \r\n               miscellaneous Linux tools. Supposedly, microSD cards are easy to corrupt especially when writing is occurring. The root cause is still ambiguous as \r\n               it could be my used Pi may be dysfunctional or that my multiple new microSD cards \r\n               were of inferior quality. There is a list of 'good' and 'bad' microSD cards for Pi's <a href=\"https://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards\">here</a> with users' anecdotes.\r\n               Overall, this has been a great experience to reduce the already excessive amount of ads found when browsing. Things to improve on would be to look into\r\n               creating an at-home VPN to augment ad-blocking and avoid as much of internet tracking and profiling as I can and to create a more stable Pi-Hole.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n          \r\n\r\n          <hr style={{\"border-top\":\"2px solid black\"}}/>\r\n          </div>\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          credits={\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <BlogCredit url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-hole\"/>\r\n            <BlogCredit url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkzIkdcd6wk\"/>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Note on the video above: the DockerFile the author provides should have both dns entries pointing to localhost 127.0.0.1.\r\n              Secondary and tertiary DNS server configurations <br/> on a computer will be used even if the primary DNS server works.\r\n              Counter-intuitively, DNS configurations do not fail a DNS server and try the next one you listed.<br/> All 2 or 3 DNS servers \r\n              will be used in no particular order.
